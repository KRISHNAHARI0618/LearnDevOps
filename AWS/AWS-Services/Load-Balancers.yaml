AWS Load Balancers: 3 Types
  1. Application Load Balancers (Layer 7)
  2. Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)
  3. Gateway Load Balancer (Layer 4)

What is a Load Balancer:
- To solve the downtime and slowness of the application we use to distribute the load based on the incomming traffic
- Basic Mechanism working is Round-Robbin Algorithim

2 Concepts are Important:
How packet flows ina network
OSI model 7 Layers

Layer 7 : Application Layer ( Application Load Balancers, HTTP/HTTPS)
Layer 6 : Session Layer (SSL/TLS)
Layer 5 : Presentation Layer
Layer 4 : Transport Layer (TCP/UDP/IP)
Layer 3 : Network Layer (IP Address)
Layer 2 : Data Link Layer (Packets,Routers)
Layer 1 : Physical Layer (Wires/Cables)

Layer 7 Load Balancing: Application Load Balancing
- Deal with HTTPS/HTTP/WebSocket/FTP/SMTP

Layer 4 Load Balancing: Network Load Balancer
- Deal With IP Address and TCP/UDP - For Games and Video Streaming Platform

SSL OffLoading
Re-Encryption
Encryption
Decryption Capabilities
It is costly and Slow as well
SSL : Secure Shell Layer
TLS : Transport Layer Security About Certificates

Types of Load Balancing Algorithims:
- Static Load Balancing Algorithims
- Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithims

Static Load Balancing Algorithims:
- Round Robin
- Sticky Roubd Robin
- Weighted Round Robin
- Hash Based Algorithim

Dynamic Load Balancing:
- Least Connections
- Least response Time
-
Techniques Used:
- Ratio Based Technique
- Capacity Based Technique
- Metric Based Technique
