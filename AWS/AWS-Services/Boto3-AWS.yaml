Boto 3 Tutorial: Python
    Integration Python with aws to create a resources
Note : Pre-requisite is how to create a Resource using UI ( Manually )
Boto3 is basically a automation

Creating Resources :
    boto3
    terraform
    CFT
    AWS CLI
Boto3 & CLI : Create Resources using Scripting
Terraform & CFT : Templating language for creating Resources.

# Project Section: Boto3
# Lambda Function: Cloud Cost Optimization, Monitoring,Creating resources etc..

Lambda Functions:  
    Cloud Cost Optimisation
    Trigger wide range of aplications s3,Cloud Watch, Event Driven.
    Cloud watch and Lambda Function to decrease the cost 
Lambda Function: 
Solving the below problems
  Compute 
  ServerLess

Lambda Function : will also give compute 
It is server less and can execute the application
it will run automatically with out making the compute services visible to the user

Cost Optimization/Estimation :
  ServerLess --> Cost Optimization
  Security --> Very Important in public cloud
  Compliance --> how secure the appilication .
  
Cloud Cost Optimization:
    If You are not managing the cloud cost management efficiently then you will end up with high cost 

Lambda Function --> EBS Volume SnapShots --> 

Write a lambda Function (Python Code)
This will talk to the AWS API
Fetch all the EBS Snapshots
Filterout SnapShots

What is SnapShots:
  EBS Snapshots are a point-in-time copy of your data, and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts, and improve backup compliance. You can create and manage your EBS Snapshots through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.
