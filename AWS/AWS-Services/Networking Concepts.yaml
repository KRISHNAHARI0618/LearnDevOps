Networking concepts:
--------------------

1) Host --> the device which receives and send/transforms the traffic is called the host 
	eg:.... Laptop,server,cloud,computer etc...
	client intitiates the requests and server responds
	servers are the computers with computers installed which responds what the client reuqests for information
	file server--> the computers conatining file availble to all the users connected to a local area is called
	
	
2) IP-Address --> Internet protocol for each host (identity)
	Ipv4 and Ipv6 -->
	ip address are 32 bits --> all about is 0's and 1's 
	0000000000000001111111111111
	
	we convert those 32 bits into 8 octets 
	01010101 - 01010101-10101010-10101010
	
	we convert those 8 digits into  format Binary Numbers 
	
	the smallest binary numbers in the 8 bits is 0 and largest 8 bits binary number will be 255
	ip address will be in the combination of between 0 -255 at any number
	smallest --> 0 
	largest --> 255
	
	01000000.00000000.01100000.10100000
	    
    2^6 = 64      0       . 2^6+2^5=32+64=96     .   2^7+2^5 =32+128 == 160 
	
	64.0.96.160 --> ip Address 
	
3) Sub-Netting --> The breaking up of the ip address based on different hierarchies is called the Subnetting 
	Static IP-Address--> Ip adress having constant all the time is called static ip adress
	Dynamic IP-Address--> the adresses having changing the ip address all the time is called Dynamic Ip Address

4) Network -->  Communication between two devices each other is called the network. 
				Grouping the hosts which require the similar connectivity is called the network
	
5) Repeaters --> communication between two devices makes difficult without repeaters 
			     regenerates the signals which can make signals easily transferable

6) Hub --> Hubs are the devices simply multi-port Repeaters --> 
		which makes communication easily transfer between multiple devices ( 1 or more)
		Hubs Duplicate the Data packets and sends to all the hosts in the connection(Network)
		
		
7) Bridge --> Bridges are the device which is connected to two set of hubs on each side 
			  Bridges only have two ports --> one hub on one side and anoter hub on another side 
			  Bridges learn which host are on each side and sends data packets accordingly 
			  if the data packets sending from host one need to reach to particular hub it will send to that hub

8) Switch --> a Combination of Hubs and Bridge are called a Switch 
			  Hubs --> multi-connected ports (multi regenetors) 
			  Bridge --> learns which hosts are on each port
			  Switches contains multiple ports each having diff port number and creates a tables where communication
			  can happen between only two particular hosts
			  
9) Routers --> a device which can facilitate the communication between two different networks 
			   Provides a traffic control point(Security,Filtering,Redirecting) 
			   Router is followed through the internet.

10)Network Traffic --> Amount of data moving across a computer network at any given point of time 
						Network traffic is also called data traffic 
						Data Traffic is divided into data packets and send to receivers end 
						Data Packets that are transmitted between devices and over the network
						
						
11) OSI Model : Open System InterConnection

The Framework Builded to transmit the data packets from one host to another host.
These Networking can be divided into seven layers based on the uses 
1) Pysical Layer
2) Data layer
3) Network Layer
4) Transport Layer
5) Session Layer
6) Presentation Layer
7) Application Layer 

1) Physical Layer :-->
				It is inside the hardware where it converts the data into bits 
				Transporting bits from one hot to another host
				Something has to transport those bits between hots those are L1 Technologies
				L1 Technologies in Physical Layer is :Ethernet Cables,CoAxial,Wires,Repeaters,Hubs,WiFi.
				
2) Data Link Layer: Hop to Hop Delivery (between NIC To NIC)
				Interacting with the wire (i.e Physical Layer)
				NIC--> Network Interface Card and Wifi Access Card  
				The Transported bits will be transfered through wires/Repeaters/WiFi inside
				Addressing Scheme : MAC Address 
				48 bits represented as 12 hex Digitis--> 94-65-9c-3b-8a-e5
Data Link Layer is the connecting points of one host to another host over the ports and transfering the bits over L1 Technologies and uses Mac Address of NICs to uniquly transfer the data
NIC To NIC (Hop to Hop) (One card to another card)

L2 Technologies: Switches,Routers,Wifi Cards,NICs (Mac Address)-Unique Mac address

3)Network Layer: End To End (Host to Host ) using IP Address 
				Addressing Scheme:--> IP Address --> 32 Bits --> 4 octets --> 0-255 numerical numbers
				IP-Address : 172.183.193.112
				L3 Technologies:Routers,Hosts ,Anything with ip adress is considers as L3 technologies.
			
Different Between Mac Adress and IP Adress :

Mac Address : --> HOP To HOP --> NIC To NIC meaning transfering data from one nic to another nic 
IP Address : END TO END Delivery --> Host To Host --> Transfering between hosts based on ip address 

Protocols:
-----------
Mean: A set of rules and messages that form internet standard

Protocols follows ARP Model
ARP Model Follows RFC826 protocol
ARP--> Address Resolution Protocol
ARP follows a request and responce Model
ARP Request: Send a Request to another system to send their MAC Address by mentioning the ip address 

Host1--> Send Request like --> Layer 2
Data Link Layer

eg:. If anyone out there has ip adress 9.1.2.3 send me your mac address 
my mac and ip is 9.1.2.4/a2a2

Host 2--> Send Response Like 
Data Link Layer
eg: Hey There i am with ip adress 9.1.2.3 and my mac address is b3b3


What is RFC836?--> An ethernet address protocol which follows over all hosts/systems to communicate and share each other's mac address

Other Important protocols:
FTP-->Port No:21 and 20 
21 --> RETR(retrive file name)
20 --> File name shows 
SMTP--> Simple Mail Transfer Protocols Port No: 587
HTTP:Hyper text transfer Protocol Port No:83
SSL--> SECURE SOCKET Layer
TLS--> Transport Layer Security
HTTPS--> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol with security which follows SSL/TLS
