What is a Databases:
1: A Collection of Individual data items which is stored in a highly structured manner is called databases
2: It Provides the ability to store large amount of information
3: allows quick access to information
it ensures security of data
Data bases are classified into Relational and Non-Relational

Data Bases : Collection of Tables
Relational Database Management Services

Relational Databases: RDS & Aurora
1: There is a Relation between tables like primary keys and foreign keys
2: ACID Complaint (Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation,Durability)
3: Lift and Shift, ERP, CRM, Finance

Key-Value: DynamoDB

Throughput == No of Requests Processed per certain amount of time
Latency == How fast that Requests are Processed
1: High Throughput, low latency read and writes endless scale
2: Real Time Bidding, Shopping cart, Social, Product,Catalog, Customer preferences

Document: DocumentDB
1: Used to Store documents and quickly access querying on any attribute
2: Content Management, Personalization Mobile

In-memory DataBase: ElasticCache
1: Query by key with microsecond latency
2: Leader Boards, Real-Time Analytics, Caching

Graph: Neptune
Time-Series: Time-Stream
Ledger: QLDB
Wide Column: Key Spaces Managed By Cassandra

There are four services which are more important
  Compute
  Storage
  Network
  Databases
AWS Data Bases:
There are several types of databases:
  RDS
  Aurora
  DynamoDB
  Elastic Cache
  Document DB
  RDS

What is RDS:
1: Relational Database Services
2: AWS Managed Data Base service
3: AWS Manages/maintains underlying Infrastructure
4: Supports MariaDB,MicrosoftSQL, MySQL,Oracle,PostgreSQL
5: Integrate nicely with other aws services

The Data Bases are divided based on the 3V's :
Volume of Database (TB/PB/GB)
Variety of DataBase
Velocity (How much fast the data should be retrieved)

Purpose Built:
Read Intensive Workloads
Insertion intensive Workloads
Write intensive Work Loads
Update Intensive Workloads

Types of Data Base Services:

Relational : RDS, Aurora-Server & Serverless ,Redshift
key-Value : DynamoDB, DAX, KeySpaces
Document: Document DB
In-memory: Elastic Cache, Redis, Memcached
Graph: Neptune
Search: Open Search Service
Time-Series: Time-stream
Ledger: QLDB
Migration & Automation : DMS, Cloud Formation

RDS:
Relational DataBase Service --> Provided by amazon fully managed the service
