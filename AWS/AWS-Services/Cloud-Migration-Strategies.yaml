Cloud Migration Stratagies: Need To follow some process
  Rehost
  Replatform
  Repurchase
  Refactor
  ReArchitecture
  Relocate
  Retire
  Retain

1. Preparation
2. Planning
3. Migrate
4. Monitor
5. Optimize

1. Preparation:
    Check the project is monolithic or Microservices
    if application is monolithic we need to convert this to the microservices
    if not converted it is not suaitable for migrating beacuse every applicationin cloud should work on containers
2. Planning:
    Rehost : Lift & Shift
    Replatform: Convert Virtualization to Containers
    Repurchase:
    ReArchitecture:
    Relocate:
    Retire:
    Retain:
3. Migration:
    migrate onpremises to cloud or public cloud
4. Monitor :
    monitor all the components for a while after migrating to the cloud
5. Optimize :
    to improve with in less budject we need to do all the steps

Preparation and Planning is one time activity
Migration will goes to multiple phases
Monitor phase goes till the complete process
Optimize: What did we achieve
