Git Concepts:
    use tab for completing the path or file name once after git command

Interactive Staging:
    git commit -i --> To add git commit messages
Alias:
    use alias for frequently used commands
    alias ga='git add'
    alias gcm='git commit -m "commit new messages"'
Stashes:
    After Developing the code if you do not want to push that to the repository use stash
    git stash 
Branches:
    Using branches do not disturb the main code base

    merge and rebase will work on the same way
    Rebasing is a way to replay your commits onto a different branch
