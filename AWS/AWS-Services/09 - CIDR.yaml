CIDR:

Class Less Inter Domain Routing

Class-A --> 2^8
Class-B --> 2^16
Class-C --> 2^24

CIDR --> we can use how many numbers we need Network Or Host IDS
We are not going to use classes.

Confusion with CIDR:
	1) We dont know what is Network ID and What is Host ID
For that Confusion we came up with new Idea Called 
	
a.b.c.d/n --> 192.100.100.100/20

Represents:

20 bits are ficed for Network IDS

192.100.100.100 --> Dividing

00000000 .00000000 .        0000  |
12345678 910111213141516 . 17181920 --> Represents Network IDS

0000 .00000000

21-32 --> Represents Host IDS
No of Hosts we will get for above CIDR --> 2^12 --> 4096 Hosts will get.

Rules For CIDR Blocks:
1) All The IP Address Should be Contigious
Contigious --> Should Not Overlap The ip Address
2) The Block Size Should be Power of 2 --> 2^n
3) In OS The Spaces Should be power of 2 --> 2^need
4) The reason is Computers should understand 0 s and 1 s
