AWS Storage:
- EBS
- EFS
- S3

What is EBS:
- Elastic Block Storage
- Data is Stored into A Unique Blocks
- Host File System Places data on Disk Using Protocols like iscsi
- Must Be attached to EC2
- Availability and Durability : 99.98 is used
- between 0.1% - 0.2%,

What is S3:
- A Bucket where we can store anything
- We can store Objects
- Object Storage - Flat Structure
- API Access to Data HTTP/HTTPs
- Metadata Driven (Attributes and Policies)
- 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects

What is EFS:
- Elastic File System
- Where data can be stored as file structure
- Shared File System Hierarchical Structure
- Comes with serving file system
- Should be Mounted on EC2 or oN premises also
- as same as S3 The Durability and Availability

Use cases:

EBS Use cases:
- Low Latency to access data
- Boot Data Volumes for EC2
- Relations ans NoSql DataBase Storage
- Data WareHouses ETL
- SAP,ERP,OracleERP etc...

S3 UseCases:
- Unlimited Space
- Media and Entertainment
- Log Files
- BackUps & Archives
- Content Management
- Version Control

EFS UseCases:
- Shared Access to Files
- Web Serving
- BigData and Analytics
- Users Home Directory
- Content Management
- Container Storage

Availability and Durability

Performance: IOPs, Throughput, Latency
IOPs: Input and Output Operations per second eg. 3000IOPs
What is ThroughPut : How Fast Storage can read/write data eg:. 10Mb/s
What is Latency: Time taken between the request and response.

Decision Tree:
- Who need to assess data:
- Data Access Pattern
  - Write Heavy & Read Heavy : EBS Volumes
  - Data Persistence : EBS Volumes
  - No Data Persistence: Instance Store

  - Write Once/read Heavy : File Storage
  - Application Support S3 Integration --> S3 Bucket
  - Operating system
    - Linux : EFS Used
    - Windows: FSX used
- Anywhere we can use S3 Bucket
