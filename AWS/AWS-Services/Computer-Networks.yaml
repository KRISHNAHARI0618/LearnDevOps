Computer Networks:
Network: Collection of Several Devices to Communicate between each other is called Network
Communication between Servers,Printers,Computers etc..

Types Of Networks:

  LAN: Local Area Networks 
  Building,College,Library,Bank
  Share the resources: Printers,Software Applications
  High Secure and Fast ,More Efficient
  Lack of Privacy

  MAN: Metropolitan Area Network 
  Connection of Multiple LAN's Is Called MAN
  Fibere Optics and More Cables
  Less Security

  WAN: Wide Area Network
  Connections of Several MAN's is called WAN
  Using Router
  Internetworks: Between Several Wide Area Network

  PAN: Personal Area Network
  Router Is called Personal Area Network

Network Topologies:

What is meant by topology?
Arranging of connection between computers in a network. 
Arrangement of Computers

Types of Topologies:
1. BUS TOPOLOGY:

  Connecting systems/computer/servers like bus seats to the one network

  Data Will be shared with every computer connected to the line 

  Collisions will occur between computers

  if we add more computers signal strength will be decreased/low

  No Security
  
  Less Expensive
  Reconfiguration will be easy
  if cable cuts or fails automatically complete network will be collapsed connected to that cable 
2. STAR TOPOLOGY:
    One Star like computer/Device will be present at center
    All the computers will connected to that star computer/device

    The star computer or Device can be SWITCH/HUB

    HUB: Transmission in hub is Broad Casting which means The data will be shared with every computer connected to that HUB

    SWITCH: Transmits Data between only receiver and senders medium

    Switch Makes the connection like UNICAST

    Unicast is sending data between particular device.
3. RING TOPOLOGY:
  Systems are connected between adjacent devices/computers/servers
  No Collisions
  No Security
  Expensive 
  Difficult to reconfigure
  if any system fails the adjacent computer also will fail
  Fault Tolerance will be easy
4. MESH TOPOLOGY:
    Every System will be connected to all the other systems in the network 
    Data can be unidirectional and bidirectional as it was connected to all computers
    Total Systems = n
    Total Links = n-1
    Total UniDirectional Connections = n(n-1) 
    Total Bi-Directional = n(n-1)/2
    Expensive
    Difficult To Reconfigure
    Any System Fails Transmission will not fails
5. HYBRID TOPOLOGY:
    Using All the Abbove topologies is called Hybrid Topology

Network Devices:
  HUB: Used to Transmit the Data packets to all the connected Devices

  SWITCH: Switch will transmits the data to the desired device and it will check the errors in the data and send good and non corrupted data packets will be send to the desired host.
  Corrupted Data Packets will be ignored

  ROUTER: Will Transmits Data based on the IP Address .

  REPEATER: It will be regenerate the signal ,connection between computer from one building to another --> Physical layer

  Signal will regenerate the siganl to maintain signal strength

  BRIDGE: Interconnected Two lans working on same protocol --> Data Link Layer

  GATEWAY: Passing data to the networks of different network models.
  Protocol Converter

OSI Model: Open Systems InterConnections
  Application Layer
  Presentation Layer
  Sessions Layer
  Transport Layer
  Network Layer 
  Data Link Layer
  Physical Layer

Application Layer --> Where user send and receives the original request

Presentation Layer --> It presents the data and trnasform into data encryption

Session Layer --> Inter Host Communication

Transport Layer --> End to End transportation of data

Network Layer --> Path Determinatiosn and IP address assigning
Data Link Layer --> Mac Address and physical address
Physical Layer --> media signal and bits conversion

Protocols Used :
    Application Layer --> HTTPS,HTTP,FTP,SMTP
    Presentation Layer --> Data Encryption ,ASCII,jpeg,docx
    Session Layer --> RPC ,TLS 
    Transport Layer --> TCP,UDP
    Network Layer --> IP,IPv4,IPv6
    Data Link Layer --> MAC Address ,Ethernet,LLC
    Physical Layer --> Cables ,Axial Cables

Protocol Data Units Used in Layer :
    Layer 5,6,7 --> Data Is used and Converted to forms

    Layer 4 --> Convert that data into -Segments

    Layer 3 --> Those -Segments will be attached with Data -Packets like eg .. -Segment[TCP/UDP]-Packets

    Layer 2 --> Those Segments and Packets will be further Connected with Frames -Segment[TCP/UDP]-Packet[IP]-Frames[MAC-Address]

    Layer 1 --> -Segment[TCP/UDP]-Packet[IP]-Frames[MAC-Address] Converted into bits and bytes and sends to another host Physical Layer

Devices used in each Layer:

    Layer 5,6,7 --> App Firewalls,VPN,SSL,Proxies
    Layer 4 --> Load Balancers
    Layer 3 --> Routers
    Layer 2 --> NIC's and Switches
    Layer 1 --> CO-Axial Cables

Physical Layer:
  Lower Layer or Hardware Layer

  Physical Connection between two devices
    connection establishment
    Maintainence
    DeActivation
  Information will be in the form of bits
  Transmission of signal converts to 0's and 1's
Functionality of Physical Layer:
    Bit wise Synchronization
    Bit Rate Control 
    Physical Topology
    Transmission Move/Media/Mode
      Simplex --> Only one can send message should not receive any message
      Duplex --> Both can be send at a time Bidirectional 
      Half-Duplex --> Bi-Directional Both directions can send the message but only one flow
  
  Devices: Ethernet Cables,Wires,Cables etc.. 

Data Link Layer:
