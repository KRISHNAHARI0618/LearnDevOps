 How does DHCP work?

When a device on your network needs an IP address, more than likely it will use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to obtain the IP address and other network configuration setting.

Below are the steps taken by the devices to obtain an address using DHCP. 

DHCPDiscover - Looks for a DHCP server
DHCPOffer - The DHCP server offers an address  
DHCPRequest - The host requests to lease the address 
DHCPACK - DHCP server sends the IP addresses to the host  

DHCP is an essential part of everyday life for our networks that we take for granted every single day! Letâ€™s Take a moment to appreciate the work DHCP does.

UDP Port:
Client :68
Server: 67


How DHCP Works?
    when we switched on the computer/pc/any device it needs one unique ip address
    then device will send a request from host to the server like i need ip address to communicate over the network
    
    Then The DHCPDiscover Takes the request and send to the DHCP Server 

    Then DHCP Will Offer one unique IP Address to the host that is called dhcp offer 
    
    Then the host will take that ip address and save it to thwe configuartion and send the request to the dhcp server

    DHCP Pack Will save the overall details of host id and mac adrres and expiry date
