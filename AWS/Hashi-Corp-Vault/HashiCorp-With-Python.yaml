HashiCorp-With-Python:

To interact with HashiCorp Vault and retrieve secrets using a Python script, you can use the hvac library, which is a Python client for HashiCorp Vault. Here is a simple example to get you started. Before you begin, make sure you have hvac installed:

pip install hvac 

Now you can create a Python script to interact with HashiCorp Vault. The following script assumes that you have a token to authenticate with the Vault:

import hvac

def get_vault_secrets(vault_url, vault_token, secret_path):
    # Create a client
    client = hvac.Client(url=vault_url, token=vault_token)

    # Check if the client is authenticated
    if not client.is_authenticated():
        print("Vault authentication failed.")
        return

    # Retrieve secrets from the specified path
    response = client.read(secret_path)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response and 'data' in response:
        secrets = response['data']
        print(f"Secrets at '{secret_path}': {secrets}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve secrets from '{secret_path}'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Update these values with your Vault server details and authentication token
    vault_url = "http://your-vault-server:8200"
    vault_token = "your-vault-token"
    secret_path = "secret/my-app"  # Update with your secret path

    get_vault_secrets(vault_url, vault_token, secret_path)

Make sure to replace http://your-vault-server:8200, your-vault-token, and "secret/my-app" with your Vault server URL, authentication token, and the path where your secrets are stored, respectively.
