VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
CIDR Consists of 32 Bits

00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000

That Means 4 Octets : 2^8.2^8.2^8.2^8

2^8 = 256 Ip Address (Hosts can Address)

192.168.0.0/24 == 32-24 = 8 bits can change that means

Range for /24 --> 255 ip address
From: 192.168.0.0
to:  192.168.0.255

Ip Address is divided into two parts :
1: Network Part (Immutable)
2: Host Part (Mutable)

AWS Has Fixed CIDR Ranges: 16,
RFC 1918 range	Example CIDR block
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)	10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)	172.31.0.0/16
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)	192.168.0.0/20

IN AWS VPC Subnets :
aws reserves 5 IP Address
first 5 and last 1
These IP address are not useful
Example:
1: 10.0.0.0 : network Address
2: 10.0.0.1 : Reserves by AWS for VPC Router
3: 10.0.0.2 : Reserved by AWS For Mapping to AWS Provided DNS
4: 10.0.0.3 : Reserved By aws for future use
5: 10.0.0.255 : Network Broad Cast Purpose

32 - 27 = 2^5 = 32 ip address
32 - 26 = 2^6 = 64 ip address
