Vault Integration with Terraform:
- Create a EC2 Instance
- Give Required Permissions for that ec2 instance
- Download and Install Hashi-Corp Vault
- Start The Vault Server
- Enable the Secrets Engine
---
Authentication:
- When you need to acces the secrets we need the required permissions through the app roles.
- We need role-id and secret_id to get access to hashicorp-vault and get the secrets
- Then we can write the Terraform Code
---
provider "vault" {
  address = "<>.8200"
  skip_child_token = true
  auth_login {
    path = "auth/approle/login"

  }
  parameters = {
    role_id = "<>"
    secret_id = "<>"
  }
}
