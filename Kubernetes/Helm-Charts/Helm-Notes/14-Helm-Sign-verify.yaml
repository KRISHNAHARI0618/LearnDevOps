Helm Sign and Verify:

Why do we need to sign Helm Charts:

Integrity
It prevents attackers from injecting malicious code

Authentication:
When a helm chart is signed it comes with a digital signature generated using a private key held by the chart maintainer

Users can verify the authenticity of the chart using the corresponding public key

This provides a way to verify that the chart was indeed created by the expected source or maintainer

When we sign a helm charts what happens:

it creates a provenance record  in a provenance file

We can verify the integrity of our helm chart by comparing a chart to a provenance record

Sign and Verify Helm Charts:

generate private/public keys with gpg
helm doesnt support latest gnupg v2 (kbx format)

for signing the Helm Chart: helm package --sign
for verifying the :

we need to export the public key to gpg format
command: helm verify --keyring public-key

helm install --verify --keyring public-key/

gpg --export-secret-keys >~.gnupg/helmsigndemo1-secring-privatekey.gpg
