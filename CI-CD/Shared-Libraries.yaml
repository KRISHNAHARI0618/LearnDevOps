Shared Libraries: is also called Functions

Create Library and use whenever it is needed

  Each Microservice has Individual Pipeline

What is a Shared Libraries:
  Making The repetitive Code as a Library in Git Repository

  mavenBuild()
  @Library('Shared-Library')

  Amount of Code which has to be write will decrease drastically
  Reusable Code
  Changing in one place can change in all the places

Advantages of Shared Libraries:

    sh '''
        echo "hello world Manully deploy"
        ehco " this is a shared libraries"
    '''
  }

  create one file with extension .groovy
  save it is the github repositoy
  Go to configure in jenkins
  inside steps call the shared library
  manage jenkins --> Configure system --> Global Pipeline Libraraies
  give url in git section
  use :
  @Library("my-shared-library") _
  give the name of the file() -->

Create Groovy File
save it in the repository
Inside Jenkins Configure --> Manage Jenkins -->Configure System --> Global Pipeline libraries
Give url in git repo and save it
Access it using @Library('Shared library name')
when calling the library : filename().

GitHub Actions:
Self Hosted Runners
What is Self Hosted Runners:
  Runners are the place where jobs get run

Code is not open --> Private Repository

Configuring Security Rules:
  both Http & Https Allow Only

How to use Self Hosted Runners:
  1: Create One Instances
  2: Use Port http(80) & https (443) & SSh (22)
  3: Use Outbound Rules http(80) & https (443)
Why using Self Hosted Runners:
  By Configuring the Host on the Git hub going to the

Comparing With Jenkins and Github Actions:
Jenkins is best for private projects
