echo "There is a story"
Jacob Grimm (1785 - 1863) and Wilhem Grimm (1786 - 1859) are the famous German brothers who collaborated as authors, philologists, cultural researchers, and lexicographers to create the best-known folktales of the 19th century. Although classified as “Fairy Tales,” the stories collected here are not necessarily of a gentle nature and might not be a suitable for all children. That's why we've put together a Fairy Tales Guide with suggested stories for various ages. We recommend parents pre-read Grimm stories before sharing with children, just to be safe! Many of Grimm's stories are a fantastic fit for young children who are ready to embrace a bit more adventure, perfect for kids thrilled, rather than scared, when the bad tempered wolf with evil plans comes baring claws and teeth! Many of Grimm's scariest tales are best suited for 13 years to adult, such as The Girl Without Hands and The Juniper-Tree.
