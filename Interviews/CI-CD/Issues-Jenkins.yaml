1: OutOfMemoryError: Your Jenkins may encounter out of memory issue due to installing heavy plugins etc..
2: One time we got issue with out of memory when we created the machine with less memory then the jobs got not executed due to java

cmd ["java", "-Xmx2048m", "-Xms512m", "-jar", "jenkins.war"]

Xmx == Maximum heap size 2048m
Xms == Initial Heap size 512m

Java Can take more memory when we are not building the application based on variable and objects class will not take memory
