There are different Types of Scanning:
1: Static Source Code Analysis
- checks the source code analysis it and can give recommendations

2: Dynamic Source Code Analysis
- mocks the process of code at runtime,Mocks the process of hacking

3: Static Application Security Testing
- Checks for Passwords or environment variables

What is Sonar-Cube:
