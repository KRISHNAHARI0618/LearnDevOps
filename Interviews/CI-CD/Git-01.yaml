What is Git:
1: Git is a Distributed version control system used to push,merge

Name some benefits of CI/CD:

Less risk: automated tests reduce the chance of introducing bugs, creating a safety net that increases the developerâ€™s confidence in their code.

More frequent releases: the automation provided by continuous delivery and continuous deployment allows developers to release and deploy software safely many times per day.

Improved productivity: freed from the manual labor of building and testing the code, developers can focus on the creative aspects of coding.

Elevated quality: CI acts as a quality gate, preventing code that is not up to standards from getting released.

Better design: the iterative nature of continuous integration lets developers work in small increments, allowing a higher degree of experimentation, which leads to more innovative ideas.

Characteristics in a CI-CD Platform:
1: Reliability
2: Speed
3: Reproductivity
4: Ease of Use

Is security important in CI/CD? What mechanisms are there to secure it:
Yes. CI/CD platforms have access to all kinds of sensitive data such as API keys, private repositories, databases, and server passwords. An improperly secured CI/CD system is a prime target for attacks and can be exploited to release compromised software or to get unauthorized access. A CI/CD platform must support mechanisms to securely manage secrets, and control access to logs and private repositories.

Git Hooks: fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur
When you want script to run when committing

There are two groups in Git Hooks:
1: Server-Side Hooks
2: Client-Side Hooks

Location: .git/hooks
when you run git init --> git initializes hooks also with .simple extension
Client-Side Hooks:
1: Committing-Workflow Hooks
  1: Pre-Commit
  2: prepare-commit-msg
  3: commit-msg

2: Email Workflow Hooks
3: Other Client Hooks

Git Rebase and Merge:
git init: initializes the .git repository
git hooks:
Git Fork
Git Clone
6 Most git Confusing Commands:
merge
rebase
reset: depends on the usage, can modify the index or change the commit which the branch head is currently pointing at.

revert: creates a new commit which undoes the changes from last commit.

fetch

pull
