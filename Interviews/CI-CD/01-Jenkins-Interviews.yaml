How to Set jenkins build to fail based specific word in console output:
pipeline{
    agent{
        docker{
            image 'openjdk:11'
        }
    }
    stages{
        stage("build"){
            sh 'chmod +x gradlew'
            sh './gradlew build | tee output.log'

        }
        stage("Check") {
            sh '! grep "task" output.log'
        }
    }
}

Can you provide an example of a time when you troubleshooted and optimized a CICD pipeline? What steps did you take and what was the outcome:

1: Issue : The pipeline has slow build process

What are all files required for NodeJs Image Build:
Index.js
Package.json
and web files

In index.js we configure port number
in package.json file we define what file should run

What are Active and Reactive parameters or Dynamic Parameters in Jenkins:
we can use build with parameters section in jenkins pipeline
based on the one dropdown another dropdown will get changed in build with parameters section it is called Active and Reactive parameters
1: Manage Jenkins
2: Active Choices plugin
3: Click Configure
4: Add Parameters
5: Select Active Choice Parameters
6: Groovy Script - return['Production','QA','Development']
7: Add Reactive Choice Parameters
8: if(env.equals('Production')) {
    return['Prod1']
    else if(env.equals('QA')){
        return['QA1','QA2']
    }
    else if(env.equals["Development"]){
        return['Dev1','Dev2']
    }
    else {
        return ['Select a Server From DropDown']
    }
}
9: referenced parameter : env

How to Customize the build number display to something else in jenkins job page:
Using env Variables in Jenkins we can customize
env variable--> Current Build --> Display Name
currentBuild.displayName="Final Demo # "+ currentBuild.Number

What are Multi Branch Pipeline:
There are Multiple Branches n One organization for one application we create a jenkins file for each file and configure it to Jenkins multi branch pipeline then automatically creates a job for each branch if Jenkins file is not present it will skip that branch

What are Shared Libraries:
when some lines of code is repeated all the pipelines/jenkins file for multiple pipelines we can centralize that line of code into shared libraries Refer when it is required

1: Configure Systems
2: Global Shared Libraries
3: Give the git where Library is present
4: def call()
5: @Library('Shared Library Name')

Resources:
Handlers:
Vars:
def call('')
@Library('Library Name')

What Type of Jenkins File you worked on:
1: FreeStyle
2: Pipeline --> Declarative,Scriptive

In Master Slave Setup:
agent{label 'my-label'}

Importance of Secrets:
Global Credentials
Secret text

How to take Backup Jenkins:
Thin Back Plugin
Cron Tab /Shell Script

What is Post Section:
Cleaning the Workspace
Mailing the user based on results
Always fail
always success
changed
aborted
scripted

Can we have job for Pull Request and once merge is done the source branch should be deleted :

What is artifactory :
Parallel Stages in jenkins pipeline:
For Testing on multiple OS systems we will use Parallel Sections/Block
1: One will run in windows agent
2: Another will run on Linux Systems

Jenkinsfile:
pipeline {
    agent none
    agent any
    agent { label 'my-defined-label' }
    agent { node { label 'my-defined-label'} }

                    }
