What is IaC: Infrastructure as code

What is Terraform:
0: Terraform is an infrastructure as a code tool that lets you to build,change and version cloud and on-prem safely and effectively
1: Infra structure as a code automation tool
2: Open Source designed by Hashi-Corp written in go language
3: It allows user to create infra with code
4: It has a Command Line Tool and Terraform Cloud to store the modules privately

---
What are advantages of Terraform:
0: As it is A Code we can write,deploy amd destroy
1: Version Control
2: Consistent InfraStructure (Dev,QA,Prod,UAT,pre-PROD)
3: We can DO CRUD Operations
4: Inventory Management
5: Cost Optimization
6: Dependency Management
7: Modules (Don't Repeat Yourself)
8: Terraform Is Declarative Scripting
---
Variables and Outputs:

1: | Variables
- Servers as Parameters for a Terraform Modules/code.
- So Users can customize behavior without editing the the source code
2: | Outputs
- Return Values for a terraform module
3: | Local Values
- Convience feature for assigning a short name to an expression
- it is especially useful when you have complec expressions or repeated values

---
Terragrunt :
- Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules, remote state, and locking

---
Expressions:
1: Version Constraints:
- we can use the operators to control the version like below
- version = ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
- there are other operators as well in terraform
- =,!=,>,<,>=,<= etc..
2: Dynamic Blocks:
- When you want to create a nested blocks we use dynamic blocks

---
Functions:
1: File Function: used to copy the file content from local to resources while creating the resource
2: Split Function : Split funtion is used to split the string based on the delimiters
3: Element Function : Used to retrieve a single element from the list or tuple
- element(list or tuple,index)
4: Slice Function: Slice is used to select the part of list
5: Length Function: Length will get the size of the list
6: LookUp Function: Value of a key in a map
7: Url encode Function: applies URL encoding to a given string
8: length (create based on availability zones)
9: slice (create based on slice)
10: merge (variables)
11: min
12: max
13: base64encode
14: base64decode
15: concatenation: two or more list combines into a single task
16: contains: Contains a string or number etc..

Hashi-Corp Configuration Language:
1: Variables:
  - Types of Variables
    - String
    - bool
    - number
    - Map
    - List
2: Loops
3: Locals
4: Data Types
5: Functions
6: Modules
7: Expressions

---
Why Terraform:
1: Terraform works on the principle of api as code
2: Interacts with Low Level Code
3: Supports multiple Cloud Providers/Hybrid Cloud
4: Written in Go language
5: HCL language/Json
---
What are essential aspects of terraform:
1: A console to validate the functions
2: Interpolation is supported through a configuration language
3: A Module count maintains track of how many resources are installed on the infrastructures
---
What are modules in terraform:
1: Logical Grouping of terraform resources
2: one module can run multiple environment/teams
3: One Module for multiple Teams
4: Commonly repeated things should be allocated in single file
---
What is state file in terraform:
1: Keeps Track of resources are managing
2: Terraform makes copy of which resources we have created
---
What is Terraform D:
  Terraform D is a windows plugin that works with almost all in-service systems. By Default Terraform init looks for plugins in the following directory

What is the purpose of Null Resources:
  A standard resource library is implemented by null resources but no further action is done
  A Null resources will not create any kind of resources but it execute some scripts in localmexec and install the external libraries

Most Common CLI Commands:

1: Terraform init
2: Terraform plan
3: Terraform apply
4: Terraform Destroy
5: Terraform destroy --target="Resource-Name"
6: Terraform refresh
7: Terraform output
8: Terraform Graph

What is terraform backend:
1: Where ever we are storing our terraform state file is called backend
---
What is terraform remote backend:
1: To remove conflicts between your team and you we will store this state file in Remote backend
2: And we store that in some where in Cloud and enables locking it
3: so that if one user is creating resources using that remote backend statefile he will get error like some has locked the file or creating the infra
---
How do you handle secrets in terraform:
1: Using Environment variables
2: Using Hashi-Corp Vault
3: Store ssm parameters store
4: Use sensitive keyword = true in terraform
5: Store the state file in remote backend and enforce it with the strict iam policies
6: Secure remote backend

What is resource graph in terraform:
  terraform graph is a dependency graph
  it is actually a dependency plan

What is Terraform state Locking:
when you don't want to run multiple people at a time
Using DynamoDB Locking

What is Taint Terraform Resource :
1: A particular resources is degraded or damaged needs to restart then in next apply this will get execute

What is Terraform state rollback:
Roll back into terraform state

How will you upgrade plugins in terraform:
using # terraform init -upgrade

How will you make an object of one module available for the other module at a high level:
1: Module 1(Providing Outputs) which create a Resources and gives an output Parent

2: Module 2(Consuming Outputs) which takes that output to create a resources

What are the components that make up terraform architecture:
1: Sub-Graphs
2: Evaluation of Expressions
3: Evaluation of vertex
4: Walk The Graph

Define Resources Graph:
A resource graph is used to depict the resources.it allows you to simultaneously alter and produce various resources

Provide a Few examples of where we can use sentinel policies:
1: Make a Unambiguous ownership of resources a must
2: Limit the roles that cloud provider can play
3: Examine the terraform cloud operations audit trail
4: Only particular resources ,services or data sources are prohibited

Degrees of Sentinel Policing:
1: Advisory
2: Soft Mandatory
3: Hard Mandatory

What is terragrunt:
Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple
Terraform modules, remote state, and locking.

1: Managing numerous aws accounts
2: Managing infra on multiple modules
3: Using terragrunt we use dry principle

What is State File Locking:

How do you deploy Infra using Terraform:
1: Create

Problems with terraform:
1: Terraform communicates to a lot of apis but terraform itself does not have an API

2: Terraform State
a: Monolithic
b: Needs Locking
c: Cannot Modify the piece of infra

How to pass environment variables in Terraform:

Using the Export TF_VAR_example_var="custom_value"
export

When you mention terraform variable as sensitive will it show in terraform apply command:
it will hide the sensitive data even when you apply

How to list the created resources in terraform:
terraform state list

Count the resources using length function:
output "number of resources" {
  value = length(aws_instance.example)
}

When two files attempt to define the same object terraform returns an error

Terraform Questions:

What is Meant by Null Resources:
1: A null resource is a special resource type allows you to define a resource block with no direct counter part in the underlying infrastructure
2: it is often used when you need to perform some arbitrary action or execute a provisioner without creating any tangible infrastructure resource

Use Cases:
1: When you want to execute the local exec
2: when you want to call external apis
3: Running custom logic during the terraform lifecycle

What is Terraform Validate command:
1: Validate command used to check the validations of resources
2: Terraform validate commands is used to validate the configuration files in a project are syntactically valid and internally consistent

How to Create a Resources Using a Loop:
1: Count
count = 2
2: For Each
for each argument must be map or set of strings
it will not take Tuple as a type of Argument

Method 1:
count = 2
var.name[count.index]
Method 2:
variables file
variable "sub" {
  type = set(string)
  default = ["10.1.0.0/24","10.2.0.0/24"]
}

for_each = var.sub
sub = each.value

How to Create a Resources Conditionally:
using the condition like ternary operator
count = var.env == "dev/qa" ? 1 : 0

variable == "value" ? 1 : 0

What are Data Sources:

Data sources allow you to fetch and reference data from external sources or existing infrastructure

data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true

  owners = ["amazon"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}

data "vault_generic_secrets" "data_base_secrets" {
  path = "secret/data/database"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  username = data.vault.generic_secrets.data_base_secrets.credentials.data["username"]
  password = data.vault_generic_secrets.data_base_secrets.credentials["password"]
}

variable "example_password" {
  type = string
  description = "A Sensitive Variable"
  sensitive = true
}

locals "aws_instance" {
  value =
}

What are local Variable: These are type of Variable where we cannot

How to Delete particular resources in terraform:
1: terraform destroy -target=resource.name

What resources can be Set variables in with VPC,AutoScaling, LoadBalancer:
AWS VPC : CIDR as Variable
AutoScaling: desired_capacity as Variable
LoadBalancer: LoadBalancer name as variable

How to provide variable at cli:
When declaring variables at tf vars don't pass any default value then it will ask user to enter

Terraform Version: 1.5
Hashicorp AWS Version: 5.8.0

Now Terraform Version: 1.7 or 1.8
Now HashiCorp Version: 5.34.0

# How to Manage Secrets in Terraform:

1: Use sensitive keyword in variables section
2: Use AWS SSM Parameters --> Data sources
3: Use Hashi-Corp Vault --> using data sources
4: Environment Variables --> /tmp/password.txt
5: Pass Variables in .tfvars

Using Data Sources We Can leverage the automation for Secrets Management

1: Using Variables files

variable "database_password" {
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  description = "Password for the database"
}
2: AWS Systems Manager Parameters Store or Secrets Manager:

retrieve sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or other credentials

data "aws_ssm_parameter" "database_password" {
  name = "/myapp/database_password"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Database Password: ${data.aws_ssm_parameter.database_password.value}" > /tmp/password.txt
              EOF
}

3: External Secrets Management: Hashi-Corp Vault

provider "vault" {
  address = "https://vault.example.com:8200"
  token   = "your_vault_token"
}

data "vault_generic_secret" "database_credentials" {
  path = "secret/myapp/database"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Database Username: ${data.vault_generic_secret.database_credentials.data["username"]}" > /tmp/username.txt
              echo "Database Password: ${data.vault_generic_secret.database_credentials.data["password"]}" > /tmp/password.txt
              EOF
}

4: Using Environment Variables:

variable "database_password" {
  type = string
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Database Password: $DATABASE_PASSWORD" > /tmp/password.txt
              EOF
}

You have a Parent Module and Child Module :
Using terraform workspaces
Terraform is platform agnostic
1: terraform workspace new dev
2: terraform workspace select dev
3: Modules
4: terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars

Scenarios:
End To End Terraform Flow
1: First Write Tf files
2: Terraform init
3: Terraform validate
4: Terraform plan
5: Terraform fmt --> Write Canonical Form mostly used in Import

One Particular Resource needs to be recreated :
1: Using terraform taint we can create a particular resource in next apply command

Terraform tain is command used to represent that particular resource is degraded or upgraded or damaged need to be replaced in next apply

1: Terraform state list
2: terraform taint "resources_name"
3: terraform apply

terraform taint and untaint

terraform taint is deprecated instead we use

terraform apply --replace=<resource-name>

# One Particular resource needs to be deleted:

terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.my_instance

# Explain the various types of meta-arguments:

Meta arguments:
changes the default behaviors of terraform configuration

1: depends_on[list of resources]
2: count
3: for_each
4: provider

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}
resource "aws" "name" {
  provider = aws.europe
}

5: lifecycle -- > create_before_destroy
lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
    ignore_changes = [tags["Name"],]
    prevent_destroy =
    replace_triggered_by = [aws_ecs_service.svc.id]
  }

# Who Created terraform.tfstate.backup file
terraform destroy command will create the backup file
it is because that to restore the infra to the same state

# Force Unlock --> Manually delete lock on terraform file
terraform apply --force-unlock

# Terraform Refresh
1: When ever there is a mismatch in terraform statefile we run this command

# Interview Session - 1:

Components used in creating the terraform:
1: VPC
2: Subnets
3: s3
4: IAM
5: Kubernetes
6: VMs

How to do changes in the already created configuration :

Using " Terraform import " command we can do changes which are already created.

State file is get and stored:
Locally or Remote Backend

If we loose state file:  There is no way to get back so we need to lock and save it in Storage

Terraform Validate: used to validate the syntax
Terraform fmt

Types of Modules in terraform:

1: Root Module: Main Module to be called with all configurations
2: Child Module: called with in the root module and get created based on the structure
3: Module Sources: Modules can be sourced from various locations.

Remote Backend: Used for Locking and storing

How to pass variable over run time:
variable.tf
variable "aws" {
  type = string
}

How to Manage Modules in Multiple Environments:
using terraform workspace

Traditional IT Infra:
1: Slow Deployment
2: Expensive
3: Limited Automation
4: Human Error
5: Wasted Resources
6: Inconsistency

Terraform Providers:
Terraform Provider is a Plugin that lets terraform managers an external api
when we run terraform init plugin required for the provider are automatically downloaded and saved locally

Resource Block :
Describe one or more infrastructure objects

Hashi-Corp Maintained: No need Required Providers section

Non Hashi-Corp Maintained: Need to provide required_providers Section

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.22.12"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "resource_name" {
  ami = "ami_id"
  instance_type="t2.micro"
}

How to debug and troubleshoot the terraform:
1: terraform init and terraform debug
2: terraform init
3: terraform validate
4: terraform fmt
5: terraform plan -debug (enable debug output gives detailed info about the terraform doing)
6: terraform state (terraform show)
7: increase verbosity using trace command
TF_LOG=TRACE terraform plan
8: to check the function issues we use terraform console
9: terraform init -upgrade

Terraform fmt:
document some commonly accepted formatting guidelines for terraform code these conventions can e enforced automatically with terraform fmt

Configuration Syntax in terraform:
1: Arguments key value pairs
2: Blocks are used to mention resources
3: identifiers = terraform specific constructs like resources,input variables,etc .. are all identifiers
4: Comments

Terraform Cloud:
1: Manages StateFiles in Terraform Cloud
2: Store Variables
Write some Code for Providers:
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.22.0"
    }
  }

Depends on :
1: Reduced Parallelism
2: Hard-Coding Dependencies
3: Increased Complexity

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  # other resource configurations
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket]
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
  # other resource configurations
}


Terraform Provisioners:
1: Local Exec Provisioners: commands will execute locally on the machine where terraform is executed
resource ""

resources "ec2_instances" "example" {
  ami = "ami"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'provisioned only oif count is even"
    when = var.count%2 == 0
  }
}
2: Remote Exec: Commands will be run at a remote machines
resources "ec2_instances" "example"{
  ami = "ami"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo apt-get update"
    "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
  ]
 }
}

3: File Provisioner:
resource "ec2_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provisioner "file" {
    src = "local/path"
    destination = "remote path"
  }
}

Assertion in Terraform:
variables {
  bucket_prefix = "test"
}
run "valid_string_concat" {
  command = plan
  assert {
    condition = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.bucket == "test-bucket"
    error_message = "S3 bucket"
  }
}

Different Types of Build in Functions:
1: String Functions
2: Numeric Functions
3: Collection Functions
4: Encoding Functions
5: File System Functions
6: Data and Time Functions
7: Hash and Crypto Functions
8: Ip Network Functions
9: Type Conversion Functions

Diff Between For_each and Dynamic block:
both are used to create a multiple instance of a nested block
for_each will work with all kind of data types
list,sets,maps,objects
Dynamic Block will work for list and sets
for each is easy when compared to Dynamic Block

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resources "ec_instance" "first" {
  ami = "ami"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  dynamic "setting" {
    for_each = var.sq_ingress_rules
    content {
      namespace = setting.value['description']
      name = setting.value['name']
      value = setting.value['value']
    }
  }
}

locals {
  coordinates = (10,20,30)
  y_coordinates = element(local.coordinates,1)
}
