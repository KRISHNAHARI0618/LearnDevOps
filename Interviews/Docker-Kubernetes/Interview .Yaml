How to Exclude Some stages in jenkins Files:
we can use conditions: to skips particular tasks

# if-else conditions :
stage('test3') {
    if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master') {
        echo 'I only execute on the master branch'
    } else {
        echo 'I execute elsewhere'
    }
}
# when condition:
    stage('My Conditional Stage') {
    when (BRANCH_NAME != 'master') {
        echo 'Only on master branch.'
    }
}

apply-skip: Enables the skip setting on a job.
apply-folder-skip: Enables the skip setting on a folder.
skip-group-on: Enables the skip setting on a skip group.
remove-skip: Removes the currently active skip setting from a job.
