What Is Elastic Search:
1: Distributed Document Store
2: Instead of storing data in rows and columns it is stored as distributively
3: It uses NoSQL data Base
4: Stores Complex Data Structures have been serialized as JSON

There are Two type of Monitoring:
1: White Box Monitoring
2: Black Box Monitoring

Elastic Search
Logstash
Kibana
FileBeat

Change the format in Nginx Configuration
Give the file beat configuration to push the metrics

File beat is sending logs to logstash
if we want to change something

First Stop File-beat
Then stop Logstash

Monitoring Important Terms:
Latency
Traffic
Saturation
Error

Grok Patterns:
Patterns which can query the data from logstash

discovery type: single node

When we want to access the data from kibana we need to create the index

What is Query ,Range,Fields:

Booleans:
Must : The "must" clause functions like the logical AND operator. Documents must match all specified criteria.
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title": "Elasticsearch" } },
        { "range": { "year": { "gte": 2020 } } }
      ]
    }
  }
}

MustNot:  The "must_not" clause functions like the logical NOT operator. Documents must not match the specified condition.
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must_not": [
        { "match": { "status": "archived" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Should: The "should" clause functions like the logical OR operator. At least one of the conditions should match.
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        { "match": { "genre": "Sci-Fi" } },
        { "match": { "genre": "Fantasy" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Range:
Numeric Range Query: Searches for numeric values within a range
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "price": {
        "gte": 100,
        "lte": 500
      }
    }
  }
}

Date Range Query:
Searches for date values within a range.
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "timestamp": {
        "gte": "2023-01-01",
        "lte": "2023-12-31"
      }
    }
  }
}

Fields:
Match Query: Searches for a specific term in a field.
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Elasticsearch"
    }
  }
}

Term Query: Searches for exact terms in a field.
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "status.keyword": "published"
    }
  }
}

Explain what is Relevance Score:
How well The particular document matches a given query
1: Term Frequency
2: Inverse Document Frequency
3: Fixed Length Norm
4: Term Proximity

Grok: Grok is a powerful pattern-matching tool used in Logstash (part of the Elastic Stack) for parsing and extracting structured data from unstructured log files or text.

filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{IP:client_ip} \[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
  }
}

Grok Patterns:
1: IP Address Patterns
2: Timestamp Patterns
3: Numeric Patterns
4: Log patterns
5: path and File Patterns
6: Custom Patterns
7: Combined Patterns

ELK Monitoring For Kubernetes:

Beats --->  LogStash --> Elastic Search --> Kibana
Syslog -->  LogStash --> Elastic Search --> Kibana
ClientApp-> LogStash --> Elastic Search --> Kibana

FileBeat:
A Lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data
Installed as a agent in servers
FileBeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify collects the log events and forwards them to either elastic search or logstash for indexing

Metric Beat:
Metric Beat is a Light weight shipper that you install on your servers
Collects metrics periodically from the operating systems from services running on the server
Metric beats takes metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify such as ElasticSearch or Logstash

LogStash:
Light weight open source data processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources transform it on the fly and send it to your desired destination
It is most often used as a data pipeline for elastic search an open source analytics and search engine

Elastic Search:
Elastic Search is a distributed open source search and analytic engine for all types of data including textual numerical geo-spatial,structured and unstructured.Elastic Search is the central component of the elastic stack mainly a centralized

Kibana:
Visualization Tool open source data visualization tool

Elastic-Search Port: 9200,9300
