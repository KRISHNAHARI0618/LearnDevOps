Extra:
1: Synchronous and Asynchronous Services

Synchronous:
In Telugu, "synchronous" can be translated as "సమానకాలిక" (pronounced as samaanakaalika).
"సమానకాలిక" refers to events or processes that occur at the same time or in coordination with each other.
For example, in a synchronous communication process, actions are performed in a sequential and coordinated manner where each step waits for the previous one to complete before proceeding.

Asynchronous:
In Telugu, "asynchronous" can be translated as "అసమానకాలిక" (pronounced as asamaanakaalika).
"అసమానకాలిక" refers to events or processes that do not occur at the same time or are not dependent on each other's timing.
For example, in an asynchronous communication process, actions can occur independently of each other without waiting for previous actions to complete.
